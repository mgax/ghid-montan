## Setup

```shell
npm install
gulp
gulp devel
```

#Ubuntu tips

```shell
sudo apt-get install python-gdal gdal-bin
# under project's home location
npm install -g topojson
```
Download file

[GEO Archive](https://grep.ro/quickpub/srtm/srtm-1arcsec-ro.tiff.bz2)

extract and copy to ''data/'' folder from project's home location

create a folder named ''contours/'' under ''data/''

Create map for specific region, eg. for Piatra Craiului (crai)

```shell
gulp data-crai # crai --> is the region name
```


## How it works

For each region, we query [Overpass](http://overpass-api.de), filter the
results, and convert them to
[TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki). Elevation
contours are from
[SRTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission).
We then package all data for a region as JSON, the largest is almost
1MB, and they compress to ~30% of the original size with gzip. In the
browser, we save the data in
[appcache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5), and
render the map as
[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), using
[D3.js](http://d3js.org) and lots of creativity :)
